                    Isn't Trick or Treating a strange thing to do?<br>
                    We dress up as people, whether they be real or fake, gross, or cute
                    and go visit random strangers asking them for candy. Isn't that strange to you?! <br>
                    Whether you go as a {{ results.field1 }}, a {{ results.field2 }}, a serial killer, or cereal killer... as Darth Vadar, or a lion, all are welcome.
                    Every kid loves feeling like they are {{ results.field3 }} and something extra {{ results.field4 }} when they put their costumes on.
                    Parents are {{ results.field5 }} enough to walk their children through the {{ results.field6 }} to get candy from strangers and friends alike. Why do parents
                    do this? I suppose because they want {{ results.field7 }}, too.
                    {{ results.field1 }}
