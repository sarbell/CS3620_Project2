                A man was {{ results.field1 }} on a {{ results.field2 }} highway on a dark {{ results.field3 }} night, waiting to hitch a ride back home.
                    After a long time, he saw a car approaching him very {{ results.field4 }} and silently, suddenly stopping before him.
                    Desperate to get home, the man jumped into the car, only to realise that there was no one in the car,
                    not even the driver. As the car approached a bend, a {{ results.field5 }} appeared out of nowhere and steered the car
                    over the bend safely. Scared the man jumped off the car and ran all the way to the nearest {{ results.field6 }} shop.
                    As he entered the shop, a couple of guys shouted at him, ”Hey! Here’s the idiot who jumped into our car
                    while we were {{ results.field7 }} it over the hill”.
